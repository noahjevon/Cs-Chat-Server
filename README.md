# Cs-Chat-Server
Server for a C# chat application. Uses WebSocketSharp for communication with connected clients.

Potential improvements:
- Merge all WebSocketBehaviours into one endpoint to reduce clutter
- Create public class for time to reduce the size of the current solution for chat timestamps
